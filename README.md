Javascript Game Applets
=======================

This is a project to rewrite several Java game applets in JavaScript. The applets were written in 1998 to teach object-oriented game programming techniques in Java, and utilized the now-defunct Java applet framework in web browsers of the time.

Building and Documentation
--------------------------

This repository serves as both the source code for the applets (written in JavaScript and HTML5), and a static website for hosting and presenting the applets. The website is published from the root directory and will contain its own documentation. A Node.js build system will be provided for adapting and distributing the applets.
